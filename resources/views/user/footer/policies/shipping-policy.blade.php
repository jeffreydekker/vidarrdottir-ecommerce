    <h1>Shipping Policy</h1>

    <h2>Domestic & International Shipping</h2>
    <p>Please review the estimated shipping time listed under each item before placing an order, as these times may vary. Each shipping estimate is provided to the customer prior to purchase. Since all items are either custom-made or produced in small batches, shipping times may occasionally take longer than anticipated. If you have any questions, please reach out via the contact form on this website.</p>
    <p>Midgaarb is not obligated to expedite shipping beyond the estimated timeframe given to customers before or after purchase.</p>

    <h2>COVID-19 & Present-Day Shipping Notice</h2>
    <p>For international orders, please be aware that USPS shipping times have increased since the COVID-19 pandemic due to updated mail processing procedures. Most international shipments are routed through a distribution center in California before being dispatched to their final destination, which can extend the delivery timeframe. Midgaarb has no control over international mail processing and therefore cannot offer expedited shipping for international orders.</p>
    <p>For herbal products in particular, please consider the potential impact of extended shipping times on the condition of your items. Midgaarb is not responsible for temperature regulation during transit or for any restrictions your country may have on herbal imports. Please conduct your own research before ordering.</p>

    <h2>Shipping Policy for Garb</h2>
    <p>Shipping times vary depending on the specific garment, the number of items ordered, and current workload. Estimated shipping times are provided before and after purchase. If measurements are not submitted upon ordering, the shipping time will be delayed. Please ensure that measurements are provided promptly to avoid any delays.</p>
    <p>If multiple items with different shipping estimates are purchased together, they will be shipped in one package based on the longest estimated shipping time unless otherwise arranged. If you wish to receive items separately, please contact Midgaarb in advance.</p>

    <h2>Website-Wide Policy</h2>
    <p>All import duties, taxes, and fees—both domestic and international—are the responsibility of the buyer. As a USA-based business, Midgaarb has no control over international shipping costs, delivery times, or customs fees. If you are purchasing from outside the United States, please be aware of potential import taxes imposed by your country. Midgaarb is not responsible for any customs-related charges or regulations.</p>
    <p>Midgaarb is not liable for packages lost in transit and does not provide refunds for lost items.</p>
