    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

    <h2>Website-Wide Policy</h2>
    <p>Since all items are either custom-made or handcrafted, refunds are only available within 24 hours of placing your order. Once an order has been shipped, no refunds can be issued.</p>
    <p>Please ensure your shipping address is accurate before finalizing your purchase. We are not responsible for lost packages or undelivered shipments due to an incorrect address, and no refunds will be provided in such cases.</p>
    <p>As a small independent business, we cannot offer refunds for items damaged during transit. If you experience this issue, please contact us, and we will assess the situation on a case-by-case basis.</p>

    <h2>Herbal Offerings Policy</h2>
    <p>Due to the handcrafted nature of our small-batch herbal offerings, and for sanitary reasons, returns cannot be accepted.</p>
    <p>Refunds or exchanges may be considered if an incorrect product was sent due to an error on our part. Each listing includes detailed descriptions and a full list of ingredients. Please read carefully before purchasing, as we cannot issue refunds for orders placed based on misinterpretation of an ingredient. If you have any concerns or specific questions, feel free to reach out before making a purchase.</p>

    <h3>The Nature of Handmade</h3>
    <p>All items are crafted using natural materials, which may result in slight variations in color, texture, or appearance. Label designs may occasionally be updated before website changes reflect them. Despite these natural differences, we strive to maintain consistency and accuracy in our product images.</p>
    <p><em>This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.</em></p>

    <h2>Custom Garb Policy</h2>
    <p>All custom clothing is made using high-quality materials and crafted specifically to the measurements provided by the buyer. Because of this, we are unable to accept returns.</p>
    <p>It is highly recommended that buyers seek assistance when taking measurements to ensure accuracy. Each pattern is adjusted according to the provided measurements. Orders are only shipped once they meet our standards for accuracy. If an item does not fit due to incorrect measurements provided by the buyer, the responsibility falls on the buyer, and adjustments cannot be made after the fact.</p>
    <p>Orders placed without measurements cannot be refunded later due to missing information. Additionally, if a plus-size order is placed without including the required fee, the buyer assumes responsibility for the oversight. Consequently, refunds, exchanges, or returns will not be possible.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to cancel orders if measurements are not provided within a reasonable time frame. Custom items cannot be made without them. Additionally, expedited shipping cannot be honored if the buyer has not first confirmed our availability before purchase.</p>
    <p>We also reserve the right to cancel any order if a customer is found to be disrespectful or undermining our work.</p>
