                Hi there, my name is <strong>Brittany</strong>. I am so excited to have you here! <em>Midgaarb</em> is my small shop,
                solely run and operated by me: a passionate seamstress, designer, photographer, and plant witch. I bring you
                Organic and Wildcrafted herbal offerings and custom, handmade historical Pagan garb. Everything I create is
                infused with Pagan pride and a deep desire to honor and uphold Mother Earth and the handmade traditions that
                celebrated her through generations.
            </p>

            <p>
                My passion and connection with the Earth is woven into every piece through the use of natural, Earth-based
                materials and ancestral plant allies. I have an endless need to create, experiment, and discover — and I feel
                incredibly grateful to live a life where my creativity nurtures both myself and others.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my craft, I seek to uphold my family’s fading traditions and keep them alive for American Europeans like
                myself. Living on sacred Native American land in the Pacific Northwest, I hold immense respect for the people
                and the ground that nourishes us. When working with wild plants, I follow restorative and regenerative
                wildcrafting practices — stewarding the land, giving back, and honoring the stories and spirits that came before.
            </p>

            <p>
                My home is nestled within the misty, moss-covered forests of Northwest Oregon — a lush, magical place that
                inspires every stitch, every brew, every story. Living in harmony with nature is not only my practice, but my
                belief. Sustainability, reverence, and ethical living are the heartbeat of my work.
            </p>

            <p>
                My heart sings when I’m immersed in the elements — whether through sewing, photography, herbalism, music,
                folklore, writing, or learning. I live to connect with nature and community alike, embracing beauty, tradition,
                and healing.
            </p>
