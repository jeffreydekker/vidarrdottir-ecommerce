        <h1>&bull; About Me & My Crafts &bull;</h1>
        <p>Hi there, my name is Brittany. I am so excited to have you here! Midgaarb is my small shop, solely run and operated by me: A passionate seamstress, designer, photographer and plant witch. Bringing you Organic and Wildcrafted herbal offerings and custom, handmade historical Pagan garb. Everything I make is infused with pagan pride and the desire to honor and uphold Mother Earth and the handmade authentic traditions that honored her in generations past. My passion and connection with the Earth is woven into all of my crafts, through the use of Earth-based, natural fabrications and working with local and ancestral plant allies.</p>

        <p>I have an endless need to create, experiment and discover! I'm very grateful to have this career where I can embrace it all while bringing for reciprocal healing. My desire in my craft is to uphold my family's fading traditions & keep them alive for us American Europeans. As a European herbalist living on sacred Native American land, I also have endless respect for the land I get to call home and harvest my medicines from. In my offerings utilizing wild plants, I focus on restorative and regenerative wildcrafting practices. I do my best to steward the land and honor the homeland of Native Indigenous People's. Their stories are woven into my creations. The purpose is to pay reparations and respect to them, which is of high importance to me, my spirit and my craft.</p>

        <p>My home is located in the misty, mossy forests of the Pacific Northwest - in Northwest Oregon, where I bring all my creations to life. The energy that constantly surrounds me, living in this incredibly lush region with the elements and the plants is deeply channeled into all my work. I fully believe in living sustainably and ethically; the lifestyle of my beliefs, & I do so to the best of my ability.</p>

        <p>My heart sings when I work with natural fibers ~ sewing, photography, herbalism, nature, music, writing, learning, European history, folklore & community connection.</p>
